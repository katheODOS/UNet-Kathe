this iteration was trained with the loss function modified to a weighted cross entropy loss

        batch_size: int = 1,

and the 512x512 single channel annotation (where 0 is the ignore index and we preserve the relevant classes of 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,12,13) tiles have a 256 pixel overlap and were also augmented by the following characteristics:

Check for 2,3,6,12 as second label
Check for 4 as first label

-these underrerpresented classes were then rotated 90, 180, and 270 degrees. 
training set is 3018 images
val set is 761 images. 

notes: the data was stratified such that the percentage of labels between the two classes are representative of all data.
